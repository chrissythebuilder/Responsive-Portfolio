                <p> Hi! Welcome to my journey to discovering web development. My name is Chriscelle (pronounced as Krisel - to make it easier for you) and I have been on quite an adventure with my career. My intent for pursuing this path is satisfy my hunger for solving puzzles while contributing to a commune success. </p>
                <p> To give you some background, I graduated with an HR degree and I am still very much proud of not only what I have learned but also the people I met, skills I have earned, and opportunities that came out of it. My interest for development came to sprout when I attended this 3-day intensive tech conference called FITC. I got to experience the immense pleasure of dreaming big and the ability to claim responsibility in bringing impact. I was mind-blown by most if not all sessions and from then onwards, I knew that I want to be in the tech space. </p>
                <p> Currently, I am a Talent Coordinator in a up-and-coming Mar/Tech start-up while balancing that with part-time fast-track programming certificate at University of Toronto. My end goal is to become a software/web developer (Front-end, Back-end, or Full-stack) by the end of 2018. My long-term goal is to have the ability to merge my knoweldge in HR/People and Technology, where this would lead towards building a more human approach to recruitment + training and development for both the organizational and job seeker's point of view. How? I still have yet to discover. But now I am determined as my Why stands strong. </p>
